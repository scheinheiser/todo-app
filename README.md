# Todo Application
A small todo application built in Odin using raylib/raygui. You can make new todos, save them to an external file and delete them when finished. I implemented a scrolling functionality so that many can be up at one point in time.

I did this as a way to learn both Odin and raylib better - there are likely some issues/bugs that I haven't caught. 

If there is an issue that I missed, don't expect me to fix it - I'm moving onto other projects, and this is simply a learning thing.
