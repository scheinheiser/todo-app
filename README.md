# todo-app
A small todo application built in Odin using raylib/raygui. 

I did this as a way to learn both Odin and raylib better - there are likely some issues/bugs that I haven't caught. 

If there is an issue that I missed, don't expect me to fix it - I'm moving onto other projects, and this is simply a learning thing.
